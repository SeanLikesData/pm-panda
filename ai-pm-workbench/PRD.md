# Executive Summary
ProdPanda is an AI-powered product management platform designed to function as a dedicated AI team member for senior product managers. Unlike traditional AI-enabled tools, ProdPanda maintains continuous context awareness of product initiatives, learns from team workflows, and proactively supports the entire product lifecycle from ideation to delivery.

# Vision
Enable a single head of product to lead effectively with an AI product manager as their primary team member, dramatically increasing productivity while maintaining strategic oversight.

# Current State Pain Points
Context Loss: Product managers constantly re-explain project context when using general AI tools, leading to inefficient interactions and repeated work.
Tool Fragmentation: PMs juggle multiple disconnected tools (Linear, Notion, Figma, etc.) without a unified AI assistant that understands the full product context.
Scaling Challenges: As AI advances, product teams are getting leaner, but PMs still need comprehensive support for strategic and tactical execution.
Generic AI Limitations: ChatGPT and similar tools lack product-specific workflows, integrations, and persistent project memory.
