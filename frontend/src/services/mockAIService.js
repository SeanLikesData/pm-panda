2. Identify your target users and their needs
3. Set measurable goals and success metrics
4. Define scope boundaries (what's in vs out)
5. Create a realistic timeline with milestones

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these areas? You can also:
- Ask about specific sections (e.g., "How do I write user stories?")
- Request templates (e.g., "Show me a goals template")
- Get feedback (e.g., "Review my product overview")`;
