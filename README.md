PMPanda is an AI-powered workbench for product managers, built to function like Cursor but for PM workflows.

Instead of re-explaining context to generic AI tools, PMPanda maintains persistent knowledge of projects, decisions, and company goals, acting as a dedicated AI teammate that drafts PRDs, refines product specs, and manages roadmaps. PMPanda enables a single head of product to operate with the leverage of a full teamâ€”cutting PRD creation time by 70% and freeing PMs to focus on strategy while the AI handles execution details. 

Where this fits in the Product Development lifecycle:

In a real-world workflow, a PM would use PMPanda to draft and iterate on the product documents, then pass the results over to an engineer using Traycer and Cline to build the technical plan and create the code assets, that are reviewed by CodeRabbit as they are produced. It sits above these other tools in the product phase of the product development lifecycle--bringing the same AI value to the product phase that these other tools bring to the code phase.
